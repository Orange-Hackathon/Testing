# Getting started with downloading the required packages

In the project directory, you can run:

1) to download cypress Packages run:

### `npm install cypress --save -dev`

2) download mocha packages to creata the automated BugReport:

### `npm install mochawesome --save-dev` 
### `npm install mocha --save-dev`  
### `npm install mochawesome-merge --save-dev`

3) to Run all Scripts:

### `npx cypress run`

**Note: Inorder to be fair, i didn't execute the written scripts as the UI wasn't integrated with Backend yet!** 

To see the Automated written Scripts you can open: cypress/e2e

I had worked on a Project like that before so to see the expected Automated results you can visit [Repo](https://github.com/CMP24-SWE-TEAM3/RedditX-Testing) for more information.
